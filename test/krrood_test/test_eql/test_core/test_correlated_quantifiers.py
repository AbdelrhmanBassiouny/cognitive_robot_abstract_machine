"""
Tests pinning first-order semantics of the EQL quantifiers ``for_all`` and ``exists``
when the quantified variable's domain depends on an outer binding (a correlated
quantifier).

The pinned semantics:

* ``for_all(x, phi)`` is the universal quantification over the finite domain of ``x``,
  ``exists(x, phi)`` the existential one, and ``not_`` is negation as failure.
* A variable that occurs anywhere else in the query scope (selected, or used by another
  condition) is outer-visible, and the quantifier is evaluated once per outer binding.
* A variable that occurs only inside the quantifier is local to it.
* ``exists`` is a semi-join: it never multiplies rows, and local variables never escape.
* ``not_(exists(...))`` is an antijoin, including outer bindings whose collection is empty.
* ``for_all`` over an empty collection is vacuously true.
