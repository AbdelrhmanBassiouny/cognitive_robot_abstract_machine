"""
Tests pinning the semantics of ``match`` on collection-valued attributes, which follow a
triple pattern: a single value or a nested pattern given for an attribute whose declared
type is a collection is satisfied by *some element* of the collection.

The pinned semantics:

* ``attr=value`` with a single non-collection value means ``value`` is an element of the
  attribute; so does a symbolic value whose type is the element type.
* ``attr=pattern`` means some element of the attribute matches the pattern; the owner
  appears once however many elements match, and an owner with an empty collection never
  matches.
* A single-valued attribute keeps equality, a collection literal or a symbolic value of a
  collection type keeps whole-collection equality, a list of patterns keeps positional
  matching, and a ``type[X]`` attribute keeps equality with the class.

The domain classes have names no other test module uses: the class diagram resolves a
string annotation such as ``set[Member]`` by class name, so a same-named class imported
by another module could otherwise take its place.
