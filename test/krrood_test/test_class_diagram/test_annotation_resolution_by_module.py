"""
Tests pinning how a string annotation of a field is resolved to a class.

A name bound in the module that declares the field resolves to that module's binding,
even when another loaded module defines a class of the same name; for an inherited field
the declaring base class's module is the one consulted. The class diagram, which knows
every class by its bare name, is only a fallback for names the declaring module does not
bind, such as ``TYPE_CHECKING``-only imports.

The test module defines its own ``Person`` on purpose, while the university dataset
module and a shadowing helper module, both imported here, each define another one.
