# workflow-unification — roadmap & rationale

Narrative companion to `plan.yaml`. Created 2026-07-29 from the tooling review + implementation
plan worked out in session https://claude.ai/code/session_014DUCCpcvLLLMYszycEBPjP (also condensed
in `pr-progress/claude/stacked-pr-restacking-kz3ptd.md`).

## Why this plan exists — findings of the 2026-07-29 review

The workflow machinery had grown into four storage locations plus a live Routine, with real
duplication and dead weight:

- **Routine prompt duplicated and drifted**: the live Routine at claude.ai/code/routines and the
  copy embedded in `dev/README.md` (lines 147–367 on `claude/stack-workflow-tooling`) had already
  diverged (FINISH section, `cram2-link-sent` wording).
- **Dead/contradictory tooling on the tooling branch**: `.claude/workflows/restack.js` uses the
  Workflow tool and sources local ROS — both forbidden/impossible under the current cloud Routine.
  `dev/README.md`'s hygiene section still instructs `subscribe_pr_activity`, the exact thing the
  Routine's HARD RULES forbid.
- **The round-robin/`stack-turn` subsystem is dead**: `stack.toml` sets `wip_cap = 1000000`
  (deliberate — size/scrutiny predicts review duration better than admission gating), so the
  fairness ordering decides nothing, yet the Routine still stamps/carries turn markers every run
  (prompt tokens + GitHub API writes steering a queue that no longer exists).
- **`claude/session-hooks` superseded**: `main` carries a strict superset of it (+1237/−6) since
  the hooks landed upstream (cram2 #479 lineage); nothing at runtime reads the branch.
- **`cram-notes.md` bloat**: the EQL verbalization living roadmap (~10k tokens incl. 22 review-round
  logs) loads into *every* session on *every* branch — the single largest recurring token cost, and
  exactly the pattern the plan system replaced (`plans/README.md` calls itself "a generalized
  replacement for one-off master-roadmap docs"). `rdr-roadmap.md` also survives as a stale
  duplicate of `plans/rdr-refactor/`.
- **Two dashboard pipelines**: stack board (Pages, auto-refreshing, LOC/CI/conflict chips) vs plan
  dashboards (Artifacts, live-session-only republish, no LOC/CI chips) — two separate
  fetch-PR-state-and-render systems.

What was *not* found: the four-way storage split itself is load-bearing, not accidental. Fork
`main` must mirror upstream (everything on it flows into every stacked branch and up to cram2),
personal data can't be on a merged branch, and the stack-board repo exists because one repo gets
one Pages site and the fork's is taken by docs.

## Target architecture

- **`main` (via cram2, stacked on PR #101)** = all reviewed machinery: hooks, plan skills (already
  there), stack tooling `.claude/stack/{stack.py,ROUTINE.md,README.md}`, `/setup-stacked-prs`.
- **`claude/personal-notes`** = all personal state: conventions (slim), pr-progress, plans,
  `stack.toml` overrides.
- **`stack-board` repo** = the single auto-publishing surface: board + every plan dashboard, one
  Action, one Pages site, LOC/CI chips everywhere.
- **Live Routine** = ~10 lines: inline HARD RULES + "read `.claude/stack/ROUTINE.md` and execute".
- **Retired**: `claude/session-hooks` (now), `claude/stack-workflow-tooling` (after one green
  cycle on the new paths).

## Design decisions (with the reasoning that settled them)

1. **Code on `main`, per-user state as config — not per-user code branches.** A per-user branch
   holding `stack.py` instances has the template-drift problem the personal-notes system avoids by
   holding only data. For cram2, personal stack config lives on the personal-notes branch
   (`.claude/personal/stack.toml`), which `/setup-personal-notes` (PR #101) already creates.
2. **Fork-overlay install mode reconciles portability** (user question, 2026-07-29): for a foreign
   repo whose maintainers won't take `.claude/` tooling upstream, `/setup-stacked-prs` installs the
   same canonical files onto a never-merged tooling branch of the user's fork — today's
   `claude/stack-workflow-tooling` pattern, but created and *updated* by the skill (re-running it
   is the drift fix). So the per-user tooling branch survives as the portability escape hatch, not
   as the cram2 default.
3. **Portability rules**: no repo names outside `stack.toml` defaults + doc examples (PR 1);
   `board.yml` repo/branch/upstream become repository variables (PR 4). Long-term option kept open,
   not exercised now: lift the whole system into a standalone plugin/template repo.
4. **HARD RULES stay inline in the Routine prompt** even after the cutover — they must be in force
   before the Routine's first tool call (a webhook event could arrive before any file is read).
5. **Plan data model and stack data model stay separate.** The board is *derived mechanics now*
   (PR bases + git ancestry); plans are *intent over time* (waves/tracks/deps). Only their
   fetch/render layer unifies (shared `pr_state` module, one Pages site).
6. **Delete the round-robin subsystem rather than fix it** — the WIP cap was disabled deliberately;
   promotion becomes "every ready, non-in-review branch; `bug` is just a label".
7. **PR #101 is tracked but not owned by this plan** — it's the stacking base (`claude/patch-pr-rheubx`)
   and its `prerequisite-check.md` / `ScratchRepository` machinery is reused by PRs 1–2, so its live
   state gates the upstream wave.

## Ordering

```
now:        eql-roadmap-migration, session-hooks-retirement   (independent)
stacked:    PR #101 → PR 1 → { PR 2, PR 3 }
after PR 1–3 on cram2/main + fork main fast-forward:
            PR 4 (stack-board) → routine-cutover → tooling-branch-retirement
```

Interim state is safe by design: until the cutover, the current Routine and board Action keep
running unchanged off the old tooling branch.

## Standing risks

- **cram2 acceptance** of fork-workflow tooling on `main` — precedent is strong (#479, #101
  direction), and PR 1 genericizes by construction, but review may push back on scope.
- **`stack.py` review cost**: 741 pre-AGENTS.md lines; bringing it to repo standards (dataclasses,
  no abbreviations, docstrings, guard clauses, tests) is the slowest-reviewed item. Scope-box PR 1
  to port + delete + standards, not a redesign.
- **Dashboard URL change**: moving plan dashboards from Artifacts to Pages changes their URLs
  (`_generated/dashboard-urls.yaml` becomes legacy); bookmarks need one update.

## Dispatch prompt: setup-personal-notes-script (added 2026-07-29)

Item `setup-personal-notes-script` (stack-tooling track). The user supplied this implementation
prompt verbatim; hand it to the implementing session unchanged. Precondition it enforces itself:
PR #101 must be MERGED first — branch off `main`, never off the PR head.

```
Extract a deterministic setup script from the /setup-personal-notes skill, in the
AbdelrhmanBassiouny/cognitive_robot_abstract_machine fork.

## Context

PR #101 added `/setup-personal-notes` (.claude/skills/setup-personal-notes/SKILL.md), a
skill that takes a clone from "I have a fork and nothing else" to working personal
notes, PR progress and plan dashboards. Review raised: does this need a skill at all,
or could it be a plain script? The accounting: every mechanical step is already a
script call, and only two things genuinely require a session —

1. deciding whether the resolved notes remote is the user's own fork (needs the
   authenticated GitHub identity via mcp__github__get_me; a git remote URL doesn't say
   who owns it, and getting it wrong pushes someone's personal notes to a repository
   they don't control), and
2. checking the `merged` / `bug` / `in-review` labels exist (GitHub API).

Everything else is either a script invocation or a question with a good default. The
agreed follow-up is to make the mechanical part runnable with no session at all.

This work depends on PR #101 being merged. Branch off `main` once it has; if it hasn't,
stop and say so rather than branching off the PR head.

## What to build

`.claude/hooks/setup-personal-notes.sh --remote <name-or-url> [--starter-notes]`,
performing what are currently the skill's steps 4-7 and 9, in order, non-interactively:

- point `claude.personalNotesRemote` at `--remote`
- create the notes branch via `create-personal-notes-branch.sh`
- seed the notes file from `starter-notes.md` via `write-personal-notes-file.sh`, only
  when `--starter-notes` is passed
- `pip install -r "${PLAN_DASHBOARD_REQUIREMENTS_FILE}"`, reporting rather than
  aborting if it fails (everything except plan dashboards works without it)
- run `session-start.sh` so the current clone picks the notes up
- finish by running `check-setup.sh` and printing its report

Requirements:

- Idempotent, and safe to re-run on an already-set-up clone: each underlying script
  already refuses or no-ops appropriately; preserve that rather than working around it.
- Source `resolve-personal-notes-config.sh` for every path and setting. Do not hardcode
  paths that already have constants there, and add new constants there if you need them.
- Do not duplicate any of `check-setup.sh`'s logic. It stays the single read-only source
  of truth for "is this clone set up?" — call it, don't reimplement it.
- `--remote` is required. Refusing to guess is the entire reason this can be a script:
  the guess is the part that needs a session.
- Fail with a clear message on unknown flags and on a missing `--remote`.

Then shrink SKILL.md to just the session-only parts: resolve whether the remote is the
user's (get_me), ask if it isn't, invoke the script, then do the label check (step 8,
which must keep running even on the already-set-up fast path since `check-setup.sh`
cannot see labels). Note there is no create-label tool in the GitHub MCP server — only
`get_label` — so creation shells out to `gh label create`, and says so plainly when `gh`
is absent rather than pretending it acted.

Update `.claude/hooks/README.md`'s by-hand section to mention the new script, and keep
its length discipline: it was deliberately cut from 378 to ~140 lines, so add lines
only where a reader needs them to act.

## Tests

Add a test module under `.claude/hooks/tests/`, reusing the existing `ScratchRepository`
(tests/scratch_repository.py) and the `scratch_repository` fixture in conftest.py rather
than building a new scratch layout. Cover at least: a missing `--remote` fails; a full
run leaves check-setup.sh exiting 0; `--starter-notes` seeds the file and its absence
leaves it empty; a second run changes nothing. CI already runs
`${HOOKS_TESTS_DIRECTORY}` in the `test_claude_dev_tooling` job, so no workflow change
is needed — but the tests must not need network access or credentials.

## Conventions

Follow AGENTS.md. Specifically: dataclasses, no abbreviations in any identifier, RST
docstrings on every field and method, absolute top-level imports, guard clauses over
nesting. Run `scripts/format_docstrings.py` on every file you touch. Commit as the human
user (their configured git user.name/user.email) — never an assistant identity as author
or committer, and no Co-Authored-By trailer for Claude; a plain "Made with the help of
Claude." line in the body is fine. Open the PR as a draft, include a link to the session
that created it, and subscribe to its activity.
```

## Addendum: tag-push and branch-delete are unavailable from a Claude Code session (2026-07-29)

`/plan-item-kickoff workflow-unification session-hooks-retirement` verified the item's premise
(`claude/session-hooks`'s tip is a literal `git merge-base --is-ancestor` ancestor of `main`, safe
to retire) and got a tag-then-delete plan approved and attempted in the same session. Both
operations failed with a real, reproducible `403` through the session's git proxy — creating or
updating a branch works, but `git push <tag>` and `git push origin --delete <branch>` are both
rejected outright. No GitHub MCP tool substitutes either (`create_branch` only creates from a
source branch; there is no delete-branch or create-tag tool). This reads as a deliberate platform
safety boundary against destructive/irreversible ref operations from an agent session, not a
misconfiguration or something to route around.

Consequence for this plan: both `session-hooks-retirement` and `tooling-branch-retirement` (the
same tag-then-delete shape, later in the `cutover` wave) need their tag-push and branch-delete
steps run outside the harness — from the user's own machine, or via `gh api`/a broader-scoped
token — even though everything upstream of that (verification, drafting the tag message, the
plan-manifest update itself) can still run in a session. `session-hooks-retirement`'s `blockers`
carries the exact prepared commands.
