# workflow-unification — roadmap & rationale

Narrative companion to `plan.yaml`. Created 2026-07-29 from the tooling review + implementation
plan worked out in session https://claude.ai/code/session_014DUCCpcvLLLMYszycEBPjP (also condensed
in `pr-progress/claude/stacked-pr-restacking-kz3ptd.md`).

## Why this plan exists — findings of the 2026-07-29 review

The workflow machinery had grown into four storage locations plus a live Routine, with real
duplication and dead weight:

- **Routine prompt duplicated and drifted**: the live Routine at claude.ai/code/routines and the
  copy embedded in `dev/README.md` (lines 147–367 on `claude/stack-workflow-tooling`) had already
  diverged (FINISH section, `cram2-link-sent` wording).
- **Dead/contradictory tooling on the tooling branch**: `.claude/workflows/restack.js` uses the
  Workflow tool and sources local ROS — both forbidden/impossible under the current cloud Routine.
  `dev/README.md`'s hygiene section still instructs `subscribe_pr_activity`, the exact thing the
  Routine's HARD RULES forbid.
- **The round-robin/`stack-turn` subsystem is dead**: `stack.toml` sets `wip_cap = 1000000`
  (deliberate — size/scrutiny predicts review duration better than admission gating), so the
  fairness ordering decides nothing, yet the Routine still stamps/carries turn markers every run
  (prompt tokens + GitHub API writes steering a queue that no longer exists).
- **`claude/session-hooks` superseded**: `main` carries a strict superset of it (+1237/−6) since
  the hooks landed upstream (cram2 #479 lineage); nothing at runtime reads the branch.
- **`cram-notes.md` bloat**: the EQL verbalization living roadmap (~10k tokens incl. 22 review-round
  logs) loads into *every* session on *every* branch — the single largest recurring token cost, and
  exactly the pattern the plan system replaced (`plans/README.md` calls itself "a generalized
  replacement for one-off master-roadmap docs"). `rdr-roadmap.md` also survives as a stale
  duplicate of `plans/rdr-refactor/`.
- **Two dashboard pipelines**: stack board (Pages, auto-refreshing, LOC/CI/conflict chips) vs plan
  dashboards (Artifacts, live-session-only republish, no LOC/CI chips) — two separate
  fetch-PR-state-and-render systems.

What was *not* found: the four-way storage split itself is load-bearing, not accidental. Fork
`main` must mirror upstream (everything on it flows into every stacked branch and up to cram2),
personal data can't be on a merged branch, and the stack-board repo exists because one repo gets
one Pages site and the fork's is taken by docs.

## Target architecture

- **`main` (via cram2, stacked on PR #101)** = all reviewed machinery: hooks, plan skills (already
  there), stack tooling `.claude/stack/{stack.py,ROUTINE.md,README.md}`, `/setup-stacked-prs`.
- **`claude/personal-notes`** = all personal state: conventions (slim), pr-progress, plans,
  `stack.toml` overrides.
- **`stack-board` repo** = the single auto-publishing surface: board + every plan dashboard, one
  Action, one Pages site, LOC/CI chips everywhere.
- **Live Routine** = ~10 lines: inline HARD RULES + "read `.claude/stack/ROUTINE.md` and execute".
- **Retired**: `claude/session-hooks` (now), `claude/stack-workflow-tooling` (after one green
  cycle on the new paths).

## Design decisions (with the reasoning that settled them)

1. **Code on `main`, per-user state as config — not per-user code branches.** A per-user branch
   holding `stack.py` instances has the template-drift problem the personal-notes system avoids by
   holding only data. For cram2, personal stack config lives on the personal-notes branch
   (`.claude/personal/stack.toml`), which `/setup-personal-notes` (PR #101) already creates.
2. **Fork-overlay install mode reconciles portability** (user question, 2026-07-29): for a foreign
   repo whose maintainers won't take `.claude/` tooling upstream, `/setup-stacked-prs` installs the
   same canonical files onto a never-merged tooling branch of the user's fork — today's
   `claude/stack-workflow-tooling` pattern, but created and *updated* by the skill (re-running it
   is the drift fix). So the per-user tooling branch survives as the portability escape hatch, not
   as the cram2 default.
3. **Portability rules**: no repo names outside `stack.toml` defaults + doc examples (PR 1);
   `board.yml` repo/branch/upstream become repository variables (PR 4). Long-term option kept open,
   not exercised now: lift the whole system into a standalone plugin/template repo.
4. **HARD RULES stay inline in the Routine prompt** even after the cutover — they must be in force
   before the Routine's first tool call (a webhook event could arrive before any file is read).
5. **Plan data model and stack data model stay separate.** The board is *derived mechanics now*
   (PR bases + git ancestry); plans are *intent over time* (waves/tracks/deps). Only their
   fetch/render layer unifies (shared `pr_state` module, one Pages site).
6. **Delete the round-robin subsystem rather than fix it** — the WIP cap was disabled deliberately;
   promotion becomes "every ready, non-in-review branch; `bug` is just a label".
7. **PR #101 is tracked but not owned by this plan** — it's the stacking base (`claude/patch-pr-rheubx`)
   and its `prerequisite-check.md` / `ScratchRepository` machinery is reused by PRs 1–2, so its live
   state gates the upstream wave.

## Ordering

```
now:        eql-roadmap-migration, session-hooks-retirement   (independent)
stacked:    PR #101 → PR 1 → { PR 2, PR 3 }
after PR 1–3 on cram2/main + fork main fast-forward:
            PR 4 (stack-board) → routine-cutover → tooling-branch-retirement
```

Interim state is safe by design: until the cutover, the current Routine and board Action keep
running unchanged off the old tooling branch.

## Standing risks

- **cram2 acceptance** of fork-workflow tooling on `main` — precedent is strong (#479, #101
  direction), and PR 1 genericizes by construction, but review may push back on scope.
- **`stack.py` review cost**: 741 pre-AGENTS.md lines; bringing it to repo standards (dataclasses,
  no abbreviations, docstrings, guard clauses, tests) is the slowest-reviewed item. Scope-box PR 1
  to port + delete + standards, not a redesign.
- **Dashboard URL change**: moving plan dashboards from Artifacts to Pages changes their URLs
  (`_generated/dashboard-urls.yaml` becomes legacy); bookmarks need one update.
