# Domain models

Packages that each model one domain. A domain model depends on `krrood`, on other domain
models and on libraries outside this repository.

- `krrood_spatial_math`: the spatial mathematics robot and image packages share: spaces,
  the coordinate systems and frames on them, the points given in those, and the changes
  between coordinate systems; with the extra `krrood_spatial_math[casadi]`, points,
  vectors, rotations and transformations in Cartesian frames.
