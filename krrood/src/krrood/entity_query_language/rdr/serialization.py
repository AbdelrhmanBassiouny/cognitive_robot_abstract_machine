Persist an EQL-native RDR as a Python module — no JSON, no strings-as-rules.

The rule tree is a live EQL expression DAG. To save it we *unparse* the DAG back into
the same ``with refinement(...) / alternative(...): add(...)`` syntax used to author rule
trees by hand, using the stdlib :mod:`ast` module to guarantee syntactically valid output;
loading is just importing that module and reading the rebuilt DAG.

    ``@dataclass`` class definition (generated from the original function stored in
    ``case_type.function``), followed by the rule-tree section which omits the case-type
    import (the class is already defined above). For any other case type the function
    falls back to plain :func:`save_rdr`.
