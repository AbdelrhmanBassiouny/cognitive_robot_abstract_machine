# Aggregation and Grouping

EQL supports powerful aggregation functions that allow you to summarize data across groups of entities. This includes common operations like counting, summing, and averaging.

## Grouping Results

The `.grouped_by()` method allows you to group results by one or more symbolic variables. When you use an aggregator in a query, EQL automatically calculates it for each group.

```python
from krrood.entity_query_language.factories import entity, count

# Group robots by their 'type' and count them
query = entity(r.type).grouped_by(r.type)
```

## Using Aggregators

Aggregators are functions that take a symbolic variable and return a summary value.

Available aggregators include:
- `count()`: Counts the number of items in the group.
- `sum()`: Calculates the sum of a numeric attribute.
- `average()`: Calculates the average of a numeric attribute.
- `max()` and `min()`: Find the maximum or minimum value.

Most aggregators support these optional parameters:
- `key`: A function to extract the value for aggregation/comparison from the object.
- `default`: The value to return if the group is empty.
- `distinct`: Whether to consider only unique values.

```python
from krrood.entity_query_language.factories import sum, average

# Calculate the total and average battery level per robot type
query = set_of(r.type, sum(r.battery), average(r.battery)).grouped_by(r.type)
```

💡 **Hint**: You can use `.distinct()` inside an aggregator to count only unique values: `count(r.name, distinct=True)`.

## Finding Extremes with `max()` and `min()`

The `max()` and `min()` aggregators find the extreme values in a group. While they often operate on numeric attributes, you can use the `key` argument to find the object that has an extreme property.

```python
import krrood.entity_query_language.factories as eql

# Find the maximum battery level
query = eql.max(r.battery)

# Find the robot object with the highest battery level
# This returns the Robot instance itself, not just the battery number
query = eql.max(r, key=lambda robot: robot.battery)
```

## Post-Aggregation Filtering with `.having()`

While `.where()` filters individual entities *before* they are grouped, `.having()` filters the results *after* they have been aggregated.

```python
# Only show types that have more than 5 robots
query = entity(r.type).grouped_by(r.type).having(count(r) > 5)
```

⚠️ **Warning**: Always use `.where()` for conditions that can be evaluated on individual objects. Use `.having()` only 
for conditions that depend on group-level aggregates.

## Full Example: World Statistics

```{code-cell} ipython3
from dataclasses import dataclass
from krrood.entity_query_language.factories import variable, set_of, Symbol, count, sum, average

@dataclass
class Robot(Symbol):
    name: str
    type: str
    battery: int

robots = [
    Robot("R1", "Astromech", 100),
    Robot("R2", "Astromech", 80),
    Robot("C1", "Protocol", 20),
    Robot("C2", "Protocol", 40),
    Robot("K1", "Security", 90)
]

r = variable(Robot, domain=robots)

# We want to see:
# 1. The type of robot
# 2. How many of each type (count)
# 3. The average battery for that type
# BUT only for types where the total battery sum > 50
query = set_of(r.type, count(r), average(r.battery)) \
    .grouped_by(r.type) \
    .having(sum(r.battery) > 50)

for robot_type, num, avg_batt in query.evaluate():
    print(f"Type: {robot_type} | Count: {num} | Avg Battery: {avg_batt}%")
```
